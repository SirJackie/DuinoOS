// A Hack.
// Arduino has a silly compilation system, that is unable to customize which .cpp file in the sub folder will be compiled.
// So I came up with this idea to make a CompilationHelper.cpp in the same folder where DuinoOS.ino at,
// which efficiently reduced the amount of .cpp file in the root folder. Haha, really interesting solution :)

// Side Effect:
// Whatever .cpp included here will have a slight folder confusion that is needed to fixed manually.

// #include "MiniDrivers/MiniInfrastructure.h"
#include "MiniDrivers/MiniTouch.cpp"
#include "MiniDrivers/MiniGraphics.cpp"

#include "GraphicsDriver/DEV_Config.cpp"
// #include "GraphicsDriver/LCD_Bmp.cpp"
#include "GraphicsDriver/LCD_Driver.cpp"
#include "GraphicsDriver/LCD_GUI.cpp"

//#include "GraphicsDriver/font8.c"
//#include "GraphicsDriver/font12.c"
#include "GraphicsDriver/font16.c"
//#include "GraphicsDriver/font20.c"
//#include "GraphicsDriver/font24.c"
